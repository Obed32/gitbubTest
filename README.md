This is a simple website page for hotel bookings. The first lines  link the html file to the CSS which is where styling was done.
H1 is the heading of the website which welcomes users the the website where they can book for hotel rooms easily.
I inserted an image which is found in the same folder where the code was.
I used the div class for the flex to position the buttons towards the center of the page.
img src is used to locate the source of my image.
I created two buttons with each opening another page for more information on another tab after clicking. I created this option using the "target=_blank" otherwise, the link woul'dve opened on the same page.
<a href> gives the option to link the button with a url or web address.

CSS
I styled the button elements such as the background color, color, margin-left, padding and text align.
I styled the flex parent, which contains other elements to display.
I set the justify content to center and the button margin to the right for positioning.
I created the hover style to give the button an effect when the cursor hovers on it.
I put some effects on the image such as the width and margins.
I did some more effects on the h1
